    "## Broadcasting Example\n",
    "In Python, broadcasting refers to a method of performing arithmetic operations between arrays of different shapes, which leads to implicit replication of the smaller array to match the shape of the larger array. This is done to avoid explicit looping over the arrays and thus makes the code more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say you have two arrays, A with shape (3,2) and B with shape (2,), you can perform element-wise multiplication between the two arrays using broadcasting as follows:"

    "In machine learning, broadcasting is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets that are represented as arrays. It allows us to perform mathematical operations between the dataset and a smaller array (such as a weight vector or bias term) without the need to explicitly replicate the smaller array to match the shape of the larger dataset. This can greatly reduce the memory footprint and computational complexity of the code. Broadcasting is used in many popular machine learning libraries in Python, such as NumPy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow."

    "It is important to remember that axis 0 corresponds to the Y axis while axis 1 is the X axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convention of numbering axes in Python and NumPy can be a bit counterintuitive at first, but it has its origins in mathematics and linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear algebra, we often represent matrices as collections of column vectors. When we perform matrix multiplication, we are essentially taking linear combinations of these column vectors, with the coefficients of the linear combinations determined by the rows of the other matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "In NumPy, arrays are stored in memory in row-major order, meaning that the elements of each row are stored contiguously in memory. This can provide a performance benefit in many cases, as it allows for more efficient memory access patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this convention, it makes sense to number the first axis (i.e., the rows) as 0, and the second axis (i.e., the columns) as 1. This is because the first index in an array corresponds to the row, and the second index corresponds to the column.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, when we access an element of an array with the syntax arr[i,j], we are specifying the ith row and the jth column of the array, with the row index coming first. This is consistent with the convention of numbering axes in NumPy and Python, where the first axis (rows) is given the index 0, and the second axis (columns) is given the index 1."
