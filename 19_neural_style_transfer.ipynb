    "# Neural Style Transfer\n",
    "Neural style transfer is a technique in deep learning that combines the style of one image with the content of another image to create a new image with a stylized look. The goal of neural style transfer is to transfer the visual style of a reference image, such as a painting or a photograph, to a content image, such as a photograph, while preserving the important features of the content image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique of neural style transfer involves training a neural network to generate an image that combines the content of the content image with the style of the style image. This is typically done using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), such as the VGG network, which is trained on a large dataset of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The neural network is trained using a loss function that consists of two parts: a content loss and a style loss. The content loss measures how much the generated image preserves the content of the content image, while the style loss measures how much the generated image matches the style of the style image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The content loss is typically computed as the mean squared error (MSE) between the feature maps of the generated image and the content image at a selected layer of the CNN. The style loss is computed as the MSE between the Gram matrices of the feature maps of the generated image and the style image at multiple layers of the CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, the neural network is optimized to minimize the total loss, which is a linear combination of the content loss and the style loss with user-defined weights. Once the network has been trained, it can be used to generate new stylized images by providing a content image and a style image as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural style transfer has a wide range of applications, including artistic stylization of photographs and videos, generating visual effects in movies and games, and image and video compression. The technique has also been extended to incorporate other constraints, such as color constraints and semantic segmentation, to produce more complex stylized images."
